<div style = "text-align: left">

We dream alone\
Who is to partake of it?\
In my imagination, anyone?\
Humor me, O, Morpheus\
For you incite my dreams.

It’s winter outside. But you hear spring.\
I’m the Italian. You’re his violin.\
What genius I am. You too.\
To articulate the seasons\
Whilst I shimmy with you.\
Our kisses like fireflies flickering in the wild\
Become midwives that bathe our love child.

We are fireflies. The both of us.\
But a twinkle in the tail to eyes that look ahead\
Is like the passion of a lover that goes unsaid,\
The affair of a mistress with someone unwed,\
And the soul of a creature that is yet undead.\
The marsh dwellers heckle,\
Aroused by our sparkle.\
In the night we shined and in it we pined\
For time and chance never was kind.

Then we are time. Time itself.\
One that gives the cosmos its heartbeat\
That which turns humans into dead meat.\
Among the gazillion suns\
Lighting up the darkness of divinity\
We were but the boring echo\
Of Cronus counting to infinity.

We go astray. Deeper astray into this realm\
Of perfect futures and vacant pasts.\
Where dopamine takes us higher\
Since time doesn’t lag desire.\
Wants are whims and our paths promiscuous\
For we are dreamers – carefree and courageous.
