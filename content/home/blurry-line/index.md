<div style = "text-align: left">

Is it asking too much of a recluse\
With only his notions to befriend\
To get over his grievous effusions\
And eschew from vain delusions

His better-half loathes her other half\
This man she worshiped till wedlock\
He shared in her thirst for erudite spasms\
Now finds his solace in unreal phantasms

Thereafter when he reclaims his senses\
And wakes up to the detrimental truth\
Only to find that his ageless confrères\
Were but fictional puppets since youth

For a blurry line severs singularity\
Lifelike daydreams from stark reality\
Spurious ghosts from his dear family\
And abrupt deaths from sheer nihility

Thus he’s called an accursed satanic\
He is but a hapless schizophrenic
