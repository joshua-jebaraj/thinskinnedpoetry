<div style = "text-align: left">

A forlorn orbit\
Betwixt now and then\
My pillow the portal\
Luring my soul to zen

In my fancy figment\
A grandiose opera\
I was the prima donna\
An elegant diva

Wealthy patrons\
Winsome matrons\
Await the silver tone\
Of my coaxing spiel

Their wits nutate\
To my enticing psalm\
Like an obeisant snake\
To the charmer’s flute

Lustrous princes fall\
With all their prudence\
Lolling carnal whims\
To my lustful semblance

The female lead\
An Olympian goddess\
From my sorrows freed\
I found my solace

But an itching gash\
An incessant prickle\
Reality reeks\
Drops of grief trickle

And time’s a thief\
It stole my succor\
All this was a con\
I was left to suffer

I was Judas\
I was Jesus\
I kissed myself\
I was callous

Nonetheless\
Past all the discord\
I crave that forlorn spiral\
To quell my own betrayal
</div>
