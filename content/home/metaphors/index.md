<div style = "text-align: left">


Still firmly moored to the deepest trenches\
While in harmony with the buoyant verses\
That are afloat upon the chartaceous oceans\
They are vivid anchors for vague notions

Stripping enigmas off their irony\
They expound confounding mysteries\
Like knots of time being duly untangled\
By a clock that’s merely a showpiece

Vivid anchors for vague notions?\
Perhaps some songsmiths impugn\
Thereon counting a thousand stars\
Seeking an overtly covert full moon

Wherein the universe is a divine mystery\
A globule of parities makes up our verity\
Surely, blaming Shakespeare is immature\
Nevertheless, all the world’s a metaphor
