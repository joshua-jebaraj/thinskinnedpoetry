<div style = "text-align: left">

Not forsaken as the Anemone\
But never loved as the Myrtle\
I am a flower thatâ€™s blooming\
On this earth so fertile

Flirty wit I do not possess\
In lack for luscious nubility\
Besides bones and red flesh\
I bear the faintest virility

Not as perverse as Zeus\
Or as chaste as Artemis\
As a mortal with needs\
I do justice to Adonis

Around me, in the world I see\
In every place I need not be\
I find fragments of hope to begin\
My journey towards within
</div>
