What\
is sorrow?\
Lament of a soul\
stuck in the limbo of life?\
Else the drug for a mortal\
too ‘fraid of the light?\
The latter?\
Wait

Muse;\
now forget\
what is good and bad\
morals and values be void\
prithee surrender them to\
the perspective of\
these words I\
write

Just\
embrace the\
tingle in your gut\
utter thrill of stinging nerves\
let grief have its routine way\
as your hormones rush\
worth craving\
right?
