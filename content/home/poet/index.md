<div style = "text-align: left">

I suggest but don’t reveal,\
Titillate but don’t conceal.

Dancing around that which is forbidden,\
I lure desperate men into the Garden of Eden.

They come in hopes of finding magic,\
On a worthless whim, they disown sound logic.

Letting them decipher the vagueness,\
I do not molest them with preciseness.

My deepest fears, they are hidden in plain sight,\
Inside walls of distrust; penned on papers of white.

Most give up, growing numb to the salacities,\
But some break through and grasp my insecurities.

Alas, I have found the most worthy intruders,\
They earn the privilege of being my brothers.

I suggest but don’t reveal,\
Titillate but don’t conceal.
</div>
