<div style = "text-align: left">

How foolish have I been!\
Renouncing virtue, I squandered my youth,\
In convenient lies and distorted truths.

How foolish have I been!\
Drunk on naivete, I evaded duty.\
A slave to impulse and fleeting beauty.

How foolish have I been!\
Rotten with vanity, I dismissed discernment,\
Declaring war on truth and its testaments.

How foolish have I been!\
To have thought so low of creation,\
Which emerged through divine dictation. 

How foolish have I been!\
To have been so thankless to the Creator,\
When I'm oozing with intricacy and wonder.

How foolish have I been!\
Oh, how foolish have I been!

## Scripture

{{< blockquote author="Psalm 33:6" >}}
By the word of the LORD were the heavens made;
And all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.

{{< blockquote author="Psalm 139:13-14" >}}
For thou hast possessed my reins:
Thou hast covered me in my mother's womb.
I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made:
Marvellous are thy works;
And that my soul knoweth right well.
