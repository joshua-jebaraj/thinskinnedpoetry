Where there are pertinent tenets in lieu of ostensibility, a path meanders vagrantly through the hillside. Winding through Eden’s remnants as it kisses the crossing of rival realms, concaving the convexes of good and evil.

Mount Zion sweeps skyward as an Elysium for the sinless. Its infinite creator prevails against the immoral, whose names don’t exhaust his journal. And cherubs flock to his senate, reciting the Lord’s sonnet.

While Hades bores earthward as a domicile for the corrupt, in tandem with the wicked, their spirits stripped bare by wanton nereids, then simmered in the sea of hatred. The fallen angel, flaunting his brimming hauteur, quenches his thirst with bloody water.

Nevertheless, the incessant strife between its contemptuous rulers warps the wits of those vagabond voyagers. Those naive weaklings who are enticed by the trail’s lushness fall prey to its unseemly seemliness.

But the shepherds of the vales stay loyal to their vows, they usher the virgins home, bearing the burden of their innocence until the wars get ravaged by themselves, and an eminent singularity abounds like those binary stars that gyrate per se till one quells the other.

What is right and wrong, but the sentiments that stem from perception. Hence that which prevails among these is but the one which the plurality sees fit. And whichever realm that may be, it shall subdue the other, and its pawns shall scour the valleys seeking vengeance against its enemies wherefore its king shall dominate indomitably

{{< blockquote author="Jules Winnfield (Pulp Fiction 1994)" >}}
The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness. For he is truly his brother’s keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you
