<div style = "text-align: left">

While my demons, they torment at nightfall,\
Please God send forth an angel in disguise.\
Alas I’m stuck, won’t someone hear my call?\
My feet are drowning in the swamp of lies.

It’s bleak and cold, why does the winter last?\
The days tick by yet the seasons they wait.\
This world with me is in graphic contrast,\
In the lake of anguish, am I the bait?

If the fake ones are them that are happy\
Where can I find it, unblemished laughter?\
From the wounds of my woes bleed poetry\
As I lie down and wash them with slumber.

But when the world skips a beat at midnight\
Will they end my endless fears? They just might.
</div>
