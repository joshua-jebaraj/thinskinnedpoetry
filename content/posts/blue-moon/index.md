<div style = "text-align: left">

There’s a place\
Not of this world\
Past the marges of space\
Where voices are ghosts\
Haunting their hosts

There thrives a tribe\
Swarming the surface\
And some beneath\
Confined in cages\
That hold them for ages

Their shadows are heavy\
That emerge from Hades\
When the Sun that never rose\
Casts beams of envy\
Past achromic windows

Gravity exists\
With polarized foci\
Their minds the loci\
East to west thoughts sway\
At times halfway

A flock of mockingbirds\
They come out at twilight\
Echoing lyrical laments\
One’s to another\
Oizys their mother

Plenty are addicted\
Some escape\
When angels pay visits\
And grant them one boon\
Every once in a blue moon
</div>
