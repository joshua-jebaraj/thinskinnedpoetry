<div style = "text-align: center">

life\
waits not\
so be taught\
that the ride’s rough\
big desires that you’ve got\
those fairy tale yarns, ’twas a bluff\
sugar-coated lies, trust me life is tough\
if only we could cross paths saving heaven’s strife\
I shall teach you until you’re wise enough\
to win wars and figure out stuff\
you are the one I sought\
we are years off\
yet one heart\
stop not\
strive!
